#calculations using the quantlib indicators calculator.
#after the calculations, we pass into the simulator, where we can run some simulations and backtesting!

#we covered some sound principles to make sure the logic is passed around, in flexible fashion.
#we don't perform unnecssary calculations - we do general calc in the driver, such as returns, volatility etc
#needed for all strats. then, indicators specific to strat is done inside the strategy to save time.

#each strategy has a config file, so that we can control some parameters.
